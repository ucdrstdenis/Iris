Iris is the practical implementation of a phase-vocoder, a behind-the-scenes tool commonly used in the music industry. Vocoders are used to shift audio pitch up or down without altering the duration, as well as compress or expand the audioâ€™s duration without changing its original frequency content.

It was a project developed during Winter 2014 for a graduate DSP course at [UC Davis](http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu).

To run the main program, simply load `Iris.m` in Matlab, and click "Run".

This program has been verified to run on Matlab for MacOS only thus far.  
It may be updated in the future for additional platform support.
